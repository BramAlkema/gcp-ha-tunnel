    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy describes how your Home Assistant smart home integration ("the Service") handles your data when connected to Google Home.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The Service acts as a bridge between your self-hosted Home Assistant instance and Google Home. We collect and process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device states:</strong> Current status of your smart home devices (on/off, brightness, temperature, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Device commands:</strong> Instructions from Google Home to control your devices</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication tokens:</strong> OAuth tokens to verify your identity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All device data is processed in real-time and is not stored permanently. Your data remains on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your local Home Assistant instance (under your control)</li>
        <li>Google's servers (subject to Google's privacy policy)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This service only acts as a tunnel and does not retain any personal data or device information.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties. Data is only transmitted between:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Home Assistant instance</li>
        <li>Google Home services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>All data transmission is encrypted using TLS/HTTPS. Authentication is handled via OAuth 2.0.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can disconnect the Google Home integration at any time through the Google Home app, which will revoke access to your devices.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about this privacy policy, please contact the Home Assistant instance administrator.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
